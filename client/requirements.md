## Packages
framer-motion | For smooth animations of the phone screen and USSD transitions
clsx | For conditional class merging
tailwind-merge | For safe Tailwind class merging

## Notes
The app simulates a USSD session.
The backend API is defined in shared/routes.ts.
We need to simulate a phone screen.
We will use a hardcoded phone number "0700000000" for the simulation as per instructions.
